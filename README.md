# hello-world
My first git repository
I am following the steps of the initial guide, to learn the first steps of using Git.
It seems to be easy to learn, let's how it goes.

Ok, I cloned the repository on my laptop, and I'm adding these lines to check how to push them to github.
I'm exited about it, for sure you will say, "he's a kid...."
